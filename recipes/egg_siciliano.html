      <p>Egg siciliano is a very easy and comforting dish. It consists of a poached egg atop a
        a slice of your favorite hardy toast with melted mozzarella, drizzled with red sauce
        and garnished with fresh basil leaves.</p>
      <p>If you have left over tomato sauce from the night before it is a breeze to pull together.
        Otherwise you can use your favorite jarred red sauce. You can source your favorite rustic
        loaf from the local bakery or you can bake your own rustic sourdough or country loaf.
        The thick cut of toast is the "delivery service" for your poached egg and red sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 piece of thick cut country bread or rustic sourdough</li>
      <li>Homemade tomato sauce or your favorite jar or red sauce</li>
      <li>Fresh basil for garnish</li>
      <li>Sliced mozzarella or provolone</li>
      <li>Grated parmigiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil some lightly salted water for your poached egg</li>
      <li>While the water is coming up to temperature, cut your
        favorite bread about 1 inch thick</li>
      <li>Shmear butter on both sides of your bread</li>
      <li>Heat up your tomato sauce over medium low heat</li>
      <li>Heat up a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat for your toast</li>
      <li>Once your water is boiling put your buttered bread in the cast iron pan and brown both sides.
        About 2-3 minutes perside</li>
      <li>To poach your egg, gently swirl the water and crack your egg into the whirlpool as close to
        the center as possible. Lightly swirl the water once again without making contact with the egg.
        Pull the egg after about three minutes for a nice soft yoke and set aside on a paper towel to
        absorb left over water.</li>
      <li>Flip the toast and place the sliced cheese on the recently toasted side. Cover the pan with
        with a lid or plate for about 2 minutes. You can turn off the heat if you are afraid of over
        toasting the toast :)</li>
      <li>While the cheese is consuming the toast, take your fresh basil leaves and stack and roll them.
        Hold the rolled leaves together and cut perpendicular to the roll spacing each cut about 1/8 inch
        apart</li>
      <li>Once the cheese has melted put your cheesy toast on a plate, place the poached egg atop its
      rightful throne, and drizzle the red sauce on top of the egg and toast. Then sprinkle some parmigiano
      cheese and the freshly chopped basil on top</li>
